to setup:

you'll need a credentials.json file from a google calendar api
you'll also need two discord applications 

Google Calendar: 
https://docs.simplecalendar.io/google-api-key/

Discord: 
https://discord.com/developers/docs/game-and-server-management/how-to-get-your-game-on-discord


Get your client secret and put it in the same folder as the DiscordBot.py file
Rename the secret to credentials.json
Put your discord application ids in lines 61 and 70
Replace "email@gmail.com" with the email used for your google calendar. 

I make no promises anything will work/not get you banned from discord/etc, glhf
